They built a house in the clouds. The earth was too stale for them.

Their religion was new. Not that it was a new religion, no; they worshipped the new.

Our best science tells us nothing is ever created or destroyed. Yet, they worshipped the new.

They ripped parts of the earth and carted them up to their clouds.

Stale, stale earth became new again with new eyes. They just want new.

They built houses, no, grand mansions in the sky, with a foundation of vapors.

Grand palaces. Art on the wall, tastefully minimialistic. Shining alabaster, pale as death

Marked only by rounded rectanges and drop shadows.

But what of the underneath? The kitchens, the sewers, where uncaring servants toiled

Open doors, free to the vermin

Cracks and crevices. The builders are long gone, Ozymandias still gloats in his glory

As his creations have crumbled. He is yet unaware

He built without understanding.

But at least it's new.

And when it's old, he'll build the same damn thing again.

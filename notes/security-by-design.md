"Computers were not originally designed with security in mind because they were giant monstrosities locked in a room."

There's an underlying assumption in a lot that lot's o people have that old shit be dumb
built wrong
insecure etc etc.

there's certainly an element of "not knowing what the heck we were doing" << 
but people literally do not appreciate how different computers are used today than they ever were before,
and frankly the mode in which they're used today is something that was *warned about* as a dystopian 

Here's a fun thought experiment. There's a quest in the game The Outer Worlds where there's some *interesting* security advice:

"Complex passwords are a security risk - difficult to remember and often written nearby. Security recommends using a simple, easy to recall code like "1234" or your supervisor's name."

Are you chuckling right now? Obviously, that's wrong, right? You know that you should have a long, complex password, so that you don't get the hacked

The thing is: in the environment of the game's world, this is surprisingly good advice

consider

Today, when we're talking about a password, we're talking about a password for a service that can be acccessed by anyoen in the world, from anywhere, at any time. The cost of guessing a password is negligible. You can make an insane number of attempts without there being anything to stop you.

In the outer worlds - and I imagine, in the [[where the fuck was arpanet?? #TODO]], guessing a password is a lot more expensive when you're having to have physical access, and that physical access is guarded by dudes with guns

In a world with no or less networking, your prime security concerns are physical. The other one is simply ... something something code diet. Making sure you know what you're putting in your machine and that it's safe enough. Provenance is the most important thing, trust is probably "good enough" though of course it would be better to understand what our machines were doing.

We are where we're at today because we *disobeyed* the security advice of yore:

- We network all the things. It's assumed that pretty much any computer can talk to any other computer on the planet, at any time. That means good guys, bad guys, whoever.
- We have world-facing services open like crazy. Multiple things running on every machine are just listening, waiting for instructions. Those instructions could be bad.
- We don't understand any of the code running on our computers, and allow them to do more than we can possibly understand. 
- We *constantly* run code from untrusted sources (hello web browser)
- We ship confidential data to third parties
